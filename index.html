          <p>
            Since I graduated in 2013, I worked in the field of designing
            physical exercise programs for various populations. I have
            experience in the weight room as well as being a personal trainer.
            In addition to my undergraduate degree in Physical Education from
            UFPE, I am also a specialist in Exercise Physiology from Estacio de
            Sa University and hold a Master's Degree in Physical Education from
            the Federal University of Pernambuco.
          </p>
          <p>
            In recent times, my thirst for exploring new cultures and learning
            new skills drove me to join an English language exchange program in
            Ireland. After spending a year and a half on the Emerald Island, I
            can confidently say that I have become a more resilient person, in
            addition to having significantly improved my proficiency in English.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently pursuing an old dream of working in the Information
            Technology field and living in an English-speaking country,
            specifically Canada. The time has finally come for me to make this
            dream a reality. In just a few years, I will be joining a group of
            individuals who rely on technology for both work and leisure.
